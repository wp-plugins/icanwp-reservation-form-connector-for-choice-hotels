<p>Using options on this page may cause conflict with other plugins or templates you are using.</p>
<p>This plugin is designed to load all the scripts through enqueue script dependencies, but there is a chance that other plugins or templates you are using is also loading the same script directly called into the website, which is not a best practice. However, if you notice any issues with the plugin, try to disable the dependent script using the options available on this page.</p>
