		<li>This plugin only works with the ChoiceHotels' website.</li>
		<li>When someone looks for your hotel on ChoiceHotels.com they can also see your competitors, which makes them naturally start comparing and could lead to a lost customer.</li>
		<li>This plugin prevents your customers from comparing against your competitors, and sends them directly to your ChoiceHotels.com dedicated reservation page with their desired room/stay settings that were already configured from your own website â€“ using the ChioceHotels plugin of course.</li>
		<li>With this plugin, you can integrate a modern hotel reservation form on any ChoiceHotels website made with WordPress.</li>
		<li>To maintain the structural integrity, please only place 1 reservation form per page.</li>
	</ul>
